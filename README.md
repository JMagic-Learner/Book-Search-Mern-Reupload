## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Book-Search-MERN.
              
Description:
This application is a refractor conversion attempt. The application originally uses Restful API. Now, it utilizes GraphQL and Apollo-Express-Server to dynamically render front-end UI while also interfacing with local and serverside databases via MONGODB             
          
Coding Process
First process was designated was to desgin and implement typedef, resolvers in the Server folder. Second process was to implement mutation and queries in the client folder. This took alot of online reference to even get right. Even then, the Heroku push attempts keep failing due to ECON refused.
